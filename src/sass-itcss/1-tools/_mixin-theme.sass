//  This mixin is used to the customize an element based on the colors set in 0-settings/_themes.scss
//
//  The first argument is required. It is the CSS property you want to change.
//
//  You can specity if you also want to customize the property on hover, using the $add-hover argument.
//
//  You can also customize both the element where the mixin is called, OR a child of the element if a $child-selector argument is passed
//  This is especially useful for the times when you don't have access to the child elements, like when they are generated via a WYSIWYG in a CMS.
